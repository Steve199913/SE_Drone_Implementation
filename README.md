# SE520-drone-project

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to revolutionize the farming industry by using drones to automate several manual processes on large-scale farms. The dashboard provides an intuitive interface to monitor and manage farm activities such as soil moisture levels, crop growth, harvest readiness, and equipment tracking.

## **Features**
- **Farm Management**: Track farm items and resources.
- **Drone Automation**: Automate tasks such as soil and crop monitoring.
- **Farm Scanning**: Use drones to perform comprehensive scans of the farm.
- **Farm Layout Design**: Enable farmers to design farm layouts for drone navigation.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **UI Design Tool**: JavaFX with Scene Builder
- **Modeling Tool**: UML diagrams created with draw.io
- **Development Methodology**: Waterfall methodology

## **Project Components**
1. **Use Case Diagrams**:  
   - Individual diagrams for each use case.  
   - Combined use case diagram integrating all functionalities.
2. **Wireframe Design**:  
   - User interface prototypes showcasing dashboard features.  
   - Includes buttons, dropdowns, and charts for farmer interaction.
3. **Scenarios**:  
   - Step-by-step functional scenarios for individual and combined use cases.

## **How to Run the Project**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.  
2. Open the project in an IDE (e.g., Eclipse).  
3. Run the `Main.java` file to launch the JavaFX application.  

## **Testing**
